# Wk_2_Code-Challenge
# Learning Goals/Outcomes
- How to use javascript alongside other programs i.e HTML to iterate through an array and access and manipulate list items.

- The learner should also gain experience in dynamically modifying the DOM based on user interaction.

- This challenge reinforces understanding of event listeners and their use in creating interactive applications.
 

# Requirements(Technologies)
- HTML
- Javascript
- CSS

# Expected Components and knowledge.
Array: Maintain a JavaScript array to store shopping list items.

DOM Manipulation:
Create an HTML structure with an input field for adding items, a list container to display items, and buttons for "Add", "Mark Purchased", and "Clear List".
Use JavaScript to dynamically add new items to the list container when the user clicks the "Add" button. (The new items do not have to be persisted once the page refreshes)
Update the list item visually to indicate purchased items (e.g., strikethrough text, different background color).

Event Handling:
Attach event listeners to the "Add" button to capture user input and add items to the list.
Attach event listeners to the list of items to allow users to mark them as purchased.
Attach an event listener to the "Clear List" button to remove all items from the list.




# Description
For this project I am required to use HTML and Javascript to create a webpage with an interactive shopping list. Users can add items to the list, mark items as purchased, and clear the list..

# Pre-Requisites.
For one to be able to run this code they would need to have the following requirements:
- A machine that runs on Windows 7+,Linux or Mac OS.
- Nodejs 10.0+
- An valid web browser with a developer console(usually accessed by pressing F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I in your browser) whereby you can paste the code intended to run.
- A valid code editor such as VS Code or an online code editor such as Codepen

# Installation
In order to be able to access this repository,there are a variety of steps one can take.

Alternative One

- Open a terminal / command line interface on your local machine(computer)

- Clone the repository holding this project by using the input:
 git clone https:https://github.com/Kevinichai Wk_2_Code-Challenge.git

- Wait for the sequence to run until it successfully clones the repository on your local machine

- Navigate to the repo folder using the cd function

- Open the repository on an editor of your choice(preferably Visual Studio Code)

- You have successfully cloned this repo and can now navigate its contents

Alternative Two
- Make your way to the repository main page and press the fork button

- This allows you to fork the repo to your individual github account from where you can use the first alternative to successfuly install this repo.

# Running the Programs
In order for one to successfully run these programs, a recent version of node.js is required.
If the application is not installed use the command nvm install followed by the version required for use.So as to ensure that the version used is the one installed run the command,nvm use followed by the version of node installed.
So as to avoid blockers and issues kindly use node from version 10 onwards.To check what node version is in use on your machine, run the command node-v on your terminal or command line interface.
Alternatively,the programs can be run on a web browser's developer console(for example,Chrome and Mozilla Firefox)
